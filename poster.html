<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Multiple imputation is one of the most commonly utilized approaches to provide valid inferences with missing observations. When the imputation model and the analysis model make different assumptions about the data, uncongeniality occurs, which can lead to invalid inferences from MI estimators.</p>
<p><strong>We propose using jackknife subsampling prior to multiple imputation as a means to mitigate issues that may arise due to uncongeniality in smaller datasets.</strong></p>

<h1>Methods</h1>
<p>Three covariates were simulated from the following normal distribution.
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\V_2 \\ V_3 \end{bmatrix} \sim N\left(\begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; 1 &amp; 0.5 \\
0.5 &amp; 0.5 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>And the outcome variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> was defined in the following manner.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y = \sum^3_{i=1} {V_i \cdot \beta_{V_i}} + \epsilon \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma \propto V_2)
\]</span>
Where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\beta_{V_1} = 2 ; \  \beta_{V_2} = 5 ; \ \beta_{V_3} = 8
\]</span>
The analysis model of interest was:
<span class="math display">\[
\widehat{Y} \sim \widehat{\beta}_{V_1} + \widehat{\beta}_{V_2} + \widehat{\beta}_{V_3}
\]</span></p>
<p>30,000 datasets were simulated with sample size <span class="math inline">\(n = 50\)</span>. Based on dataset characteristics, the ideal number of subsamples/resamples was found to be <span class="math inline">\(j = 200\)</span>, and the number of imputations <span class="math inline">\(m=10\)</span> when the method of inference was Rubin’s Rules, and <span class="math inline">\(m=2\)</span> otherwise. Lastly, the goal of the analysis was to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{V_1}\)</span>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Across all levels of missingness, the jackknife estimator obtained the least biased estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{V_1}\)</span>. Nearly all methods were unbiased at lower levels of missingness; however, at higher levels of missingness, only the jackknife estimator was unbiased. Lastly, we see that the jackknife estimates maintained their consistency even at higher levels of missingness, where other appraoches began producing highly varied estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{V_1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Unsuprisingly, Rubin’s Rules was the fastest approach, which was nearly two and a half times faster than the jackknife approach and 23 times faster than the bootstrap approach. In contrast, the jackknife approach was nearly eight and a half times faster than the bootstrap approach.</p>
